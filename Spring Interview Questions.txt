Check out the simplest method possible used to create a basic "Hello World!" example. Of course, there are many ways to accomplish that, but we'll choose the simplest one. We'll make use of Spring Initializr. With the selected language, version, and dependencies, that tool will automatically build the base project for us. 

12. What are the Spring Boot Annotations?
@SpringBootApplication: A configuration class that defines one or more @Bean methods and initiates auto-configuration and component scanning is indicated by the annotation.
@EnableAutoConfiguration: Using the jar dependencies you have provided, the @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation instructs Spring Boot to "guess" how you want to configure Spring.
@ConditionalOnMissingClass: The Class conditions are these comments' home. Depending on the existence or absence of particular classes, a configuration can be included using the @ConditionalOnClass and @ConditionalOnMissingClass annotations.
@Conditional: A class evaluating the specific condition can be made for circumstances that are even more complicated.

13. What are the Spring Boot properties?
Spring Boot Properties files are used to configure its auto-configuration and application properties. Spring Boot has many properties that can be used to configure the behavior of the application. Some of the commonly used properties in Spring Boot include server.port, spring.profiles.active, spring.datasource.url, spring.jpa.show-sql, and many more.

Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies Spring development by providing a pre-configured environment that enables developers to focus on building the application logic.


23. What is a Swagger in Spring Boot?
Swagger is used for clearly detailing and documenting RESTful APIs in a machine-readable and human-readable format, which is easily comprehensible for testers and developers, as well as individuals having little knowledge of source code.

Enabling hassle-free application discovery, development, and integration, Swagger allows API consumers to interact with remote services with minimum implementation logic.

24. What are Profiles in Spring Boot?
Profiles in the Spring framework enables users to map components and beans to specific profiles, such as the Development (dev) profile, Production (prod) profile, or the Test profile. 

In Spring Boot, the annotation @Profile is used to map components and beans to a certain profile. 

Developers can also set up profiles using the SpringApplication, for instance, SpringApplication.setAdditionalProfiles("dev");

25. What differentiates Spring Data JPA and Hibernate?
A Java Persistence API (JPA) implementation, Hibernate facilitates Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), allowing users to store, retrieve, map, and update application data to and from Java objects and relational databases. Hibernate maps the data types in Java to SQL (Structured Query Language) data types, and the classes in java to the database tables, relieving developers from scripting data persistence SQL programs. 

A Spring Data sub-project, Spring Data JPA, on the other hand, gives abstraction over the DAL (Data Access Layer) applying JPA and Object–Relational Mapping implementations, such as Hibernate. Spring Data JPA facilitates the smooth implementation of JPA repositories, and it intends to improve the overall implementation of DAL to a great extent.

26. How are the @RestController and @Controller Annotation different?
The traditional Spring @Controller annotation specifies that an annotated class represents a controller. It’s basically a @Component specialization, and it is autodetected via the classpath scanning. The @Controller annotation is used along with the annotated handler methodologies based on @RequestMapping annotations.

Developers use the @RestController annotation to develop RESTful web services, utilizing the Spring Model–View–Controller (MVC). The Spring @RestController maps the request data to specified request handler methods. Once the handler method generates the response body, the @RestController modifies it to XML or JSON response.
