OOPS
----
oops provider clear structure programs.

easy to maintains  |
easy to reuses     | identified 
easy to debugs     |

less code and short time development.

what is class and objects:
class is a template for objects or blueprint.
object is an instance of class or compile time memory allocation.

oops main principle
-------------------
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation

Inheritance
-----------
class to use data and method from another class.

Subclass   => child
Superclass => parent

Superclass data access(extends) keywords use it.
Superclass class (attributes, methods) access extends use it.

inheritance type
----------------
single inheritance
multilevel inheritance
hierarchical inheritance
multiple inheritance
hybrid inheritance

single inheritance
------------------
one parent class and one child class.

multilevel inheritance
----------------------
one parent class and more than child class.

hierarchical inheritance
-------------------------
one child class and more than parent class.

hybrid inheritance
------------------
combination of single and multiple inheritance.

multiple inheritance
--------------------
multiple not work extends keyword.

why multiple not work
---------------------
priority problems
syntax problems
compile time error
support only interface concept.
