type of variable
-----------------
local variable
instance variable
static variable

local variable (method level variable)
--------------------------------------
it declare inside the method on block or constructor.
it get activated when control enter to the method.
it get deactivated when exists the method, it is stored in stack memory.
we can't declare any access specifiers for local variable.
we need to initialize the values not take default value automatically.

instance variable (object level variable)
-----------------------------------------
it is get activated when the object is created.
it get stored deactivated when object is destroyed.
it is stored in heap memory.
we can use declare access any specifiers for instance variables.
we need to initialize the values for instance it take default value automatically.

static variable (class level variable)
--------------------------------------
it is declare inside class and outside the method.
it get activate when control enters into class.
it stored in static memory.
