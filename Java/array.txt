array
-----
we can store multiple values of similar data types in single variable name.
array is index based on index start from 0 and -1.
it is fixed size.

array syntax
------------
Datatype variable[] = new Datatype[size];

disadvantages of array
----------------------
memory wastage very high (memory is allocated at compile time)
it only support similar data types.

For loop and Each loop
----------------------

for loop
--------
index based
apply the conditions
index related error
less efficient

each loop
----------
value based
we can't apply any conditions
we if any error
more efficient
